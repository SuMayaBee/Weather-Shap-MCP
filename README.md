## Motivation

Every weather app tells you *what* — 70% chance of rain, UV index 8, air quality moderate. But nobody ever tells you *why*.

And that's the part that actually matters. If you know it's going to rain because of a big overnight humidity build-up, you make different decisions than if it's just a passing cloud. If the air quality is poor because wind dropped to almost zero, you understand it'll clear up by evening. The number alone doesn't give you that.

So I built this. You ask a plain question — *"why will it rain on Thursday?"* — and you get a real answer: which weather signals are driving the prediction, how much each one is pushing it up or down, and what that means in plain English. No guessing, no vague "weather patterns suggest...". The explanations come from [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/), a tool used by data scientists to understand exactly why a machine learning model made a specific decision.

The fun part is that SHAP is almost always used in research notebooks — you run it after training, look at the charts, and that's it. This project uses it live, inside a chat, so you can ask *why* about any city, any day, right now.

## What makes this different

Most weather MCP servers return raw forecast numbers. This one also tells you **why** — using real [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/) `TreeExplainer` values from trained XGBoost models:

- **4 separate XGBoost models** per city — rain (classifier), UV index (regressor), feels-like temperature (regressor), air quality AQI (regressor)
- **Real `shap.TreeExplainer`** — exact Shapley values, not approximations or hand-written scores
- **SHAP waterfall plots** returned as inline images directly in the chat
- **Trained on 2 years of live historical data** per city — models adapt to local climate patterns
- **Zero API keys** — all data from Open-Meteo's free endpoints

## Example conversations

### Rain forecast

**Ask:** **`"Will it rain in Dhaka this week?"`**

**Returns:** 7-day bar chart with daily rain probabilities

### SHAP explanation — why will it rain?

**Ask:** **`"Why is it predicted to rain on day 1?"`**

**Returns:** SHAP waterfall plot + plain-English — *"Heavy forecast precipitation (7.9 mm) strongly pushes rain chance up. Warm overnight low (26°C) moderately pushes rain chance up..."*

---

### UV + heat forecast

**Ask:** **`"How hot and sunny will it be in Dubai this week?"`**

**Returns:** Dual-axis chart — UV index bars + feels-like temperature line

---

### Air quality forecast

**Ask:** **`"Is the air safe to breathe in Delhi today?"`**

**Returns:** AQI bars with PM2.5/PM10 lines and WHO limit markers

### SHAP explanation — why is air quality poor?

**Ask:** **`"Why is the air quality so poor on day 1?"`**

**Returns:** SHAP waterfall — *"Very low wind (3 km/h — pollutants accumulate) strongly worsens air quality. No rain (0 mm — no washout) moderately worsens air quality..."*

<img width="900" alt="SHAP air quality explanation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5014ccc4-2d02-413e-b415-c69a22d99050" />

---

### Best day finder

**Ask:** **`"What's the best day for an outdoor event in Tokyo this week?"`**

**Returns:** *"Thursday (score 82/100 — Excellent). Low rain chance (12%), comfortable temperature (24°C), UV moderate."*

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuMayaBee/weather-shap-mcp.git
cd weather-shap-mcp
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Linux / macOS)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -e .
```

### 3. Verify it works

```bash
venv/bin/weather-mcp
# Server starts and waits for MCP connections over stdio — Ctrl+C to stop
```

On Windows: `venv\Scripts\weather-mcp.exe`

## Connect to Cursor

The repo includes a `.cursor/mcp.json` — open the cloned folder directly in Cursor and it picks it up automatically.

Or add manually in **Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP → Add new MCP server**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/weather-shap-mcp/venv/bin/weather-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/` with the actual path where you cloned the repo.

## Connect to VS Code

The repo includes a `.vscode/mcp.json`. Or add to your workspace `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "weather": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/weather-shap-mcp/venv/bin/weather-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Connect to Claude Desktop

Edit `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Linux) or
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/weather-shap-mcp/venv/bin/weather-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

```

**SHAP implementation:**
- `shap.TreeExplainer` — exact Shapley values (not sampling-based approximation)
- `shap.Explanation` + `shap.plots.waterfall` — standard SHAP waterfall plots
- Same 4 features across all models: `[precipitation, temp_max, temp_min, windspeed]`
- Each model has its own explainer — SHAP contributions are model-specific, so the same feature can push rain up but push AQI down

## Data sources

| Source | Endpoint | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Open-Meteo Geocoding | `geocoding-api.open-meteo.com` | City → lat/lon |
| Open-Meteo Archive (ERA5) | `archive-api.open-meteo.com` | 2yr historical training data |
| Open-Meteo Forecast | `api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast` | Live 7-day inference data |
| Open-Meteo Air Quality (CAMS) | `air-quality-api.open-meteo.com` | PM2.5, PM10, AQI |

No API keys required for any of these.

## Notes

- Models are cached in-process per city. Restarting the server retrains on next query (~10–20s for first call per city).
- Location keys are rounded to 2 decimal places (~1 km), so nearby queries share the same cached model.
- If archive UV data is unavailable for a location (ERA5 coverage gap), the UV model is trained on synthesised data derived from temperature + precipitation correlations.
- AQI model uses 90 days of historical air quality data (Open-Meteo CAMS limit). Requires ≥ 30 days to train — falls back gracefully if unavailable.
